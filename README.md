# Facial_KyPoint_Recog_Pytorch
This is a UDACITY NANO DEGREE COMPUTER VISION PROJECT IN PYTORCH. I applied various vision techniques in the project . This had been a fun project. My model could identify former firstlady Michelle Obama's facial features with less than 2% error . This is an ongoing project where I will be adding more cool features to it. 
I thank Deeplizard for their amazing YOutube video series on Pytorch !!
This project helped me to understand in detail how a CNN filters these images in order to get the feature vectors, which are the filters at various levels of feature extractions through out the network progression .
I have tried various methods to understand the concepts here .
Pytorch is a very easy framework to understand and debug.
